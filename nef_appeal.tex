\begin{abstract}
We introduce an explicit solution for the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) 
of a ring that is coupled to a thermal bath, and is driven by an external 
hot source with log-wide distribution of couplings. 
Having time scales that stretch over several decades is similar to glassy systems.
Consequently there is a wide range of driving intensities where the NESS 
is like that of a random walker in a biased Brownian landscape. 
We investigate the resulting statistics of the induced current~$I$. 
For a single ring we discuss how $\text{sign}(I)$ fluctuates as the intensity 
of the driving is increased, while for an ensemble of rings we highlight 
the fingerprints of Sinai physics on the $\text{abs}(I)$ distribution.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The transport in a chain due to random non-symmetric transition probabilities
is a fundamental problem in statistical mechanics \cite{derrida,d1,d2,d3,d4,sinai,sinai2}.
%
This type of dynamics is of great relevance for surface diffusion \cite{surface}, 
thermal ratchets~\cite{brownian1,brownian2,brownian3,ratchets}  
and was used to model diverse biological systems, 
such as molecular motors, enzymes, and unidirectional motion 
of proteins along filaments \cite{motors1,brownian4,motors2,motors3}.
Of particular interest are applications that concern the conduction 
of DNA segments \cite{DNA1,DNA3}, and thin glassy electrolytes under high voltages 
\cite{Wichmann,Roling1,Roling2,Roling3,Nitzan}.

Mathematically one can visualize the dynamics 
as a {\em a random-walk in a random environment}: 
a particle that makes incoherent jumps between ``sites" of a network.
In an unbounded quasi-one-dimensional network we might have either diffusion 
or sub-diffusive Sinai spreading \cite{sinai}, 
depending on whether the transitions rates 
form a symmetric matrix or not. In contrast, when the system is bounded 
(and without disjoint components) 
it eventually reaches a well-defined steady state. 
This would be an equilibrium {\em canonical} (Boltzmann) state if the transition rates 
were detailed-balanced, else it is termed non-equilibrium steady state (NESS). 

\rmrk{We consider the NESS of a mesoscopically glassy system.
{\em Our working hypothesis is that glassiness might lead to a novel NESS
with fingerprints of Sinai physics.}}
%
By ``glassiness" we mean that the rates that are induced by a bath, 
or by an external source, have a log-wide distribution,
hence \rmrk{many time scales are involved} \cite{Rit1} as in spin-glass models \cite{Rit2}.  
%
\rmrk{Having a log-wide distribution of time scales is typical 
for hopping in a random energy landscape, 
where the rates depend exponentially on the barrier heights.
It also arises in driven quasi-integrable systems, 
where due to approximate selection-rules there is a ``sparse" fraction 
of large coupling-elements, while the majority become very small \cite{slk}. }

\rmrk{
We consider a geometrically closed mesoscopic system 
that has a non-trivial topology. The system is immersed in 
a finite temperature ``cold" bath, and additionally 
it is coupled to a driving source. 
The latter can be regarded as a ``hot bath" of infinite temperature. 
Consequently detailed-balance is spoiled, 
and after a transient a NESS is reached. 
%
Specifically we consider the simplest possible model: 
a mesoscopic ring that is made up of~$N$ sites. 
See \cite{SM} for a graphical illustration.
%
Due to the lack of detailed-balance a circulating current is induced.
We shall see that the value of the current depends in a non-linear way 
on the intensity of the driving source. Our interest 
is in the statistical aspects of this dependence.        
}


\rmrk{The emergence of Sinai physics in a system that is described 
by a rate equation with asymmetric transition probabilities is 
naturally expected, but not self-evident \cite{Rit3}.
An experimental observation of Sinai diffusion regarding the unzipping 
transition of DNA molecules has been reported \cite{Nelson},
and other applications have been considered \cite{domainwalls,sandpiles}.
%
The non-linear current depedence of a mesoscopic rings has 
been theoretically studied in the past \cite{Wichmann,Nitzan}, 
with references to experiments \cite{Roling1,Roling2,Roling3}, 
but the statistical aspects, and the possible relevance 
of Sinai physics, have not been considered.} 
%
In previous publications, we have pointed out that due to ``glassiness" 
Sinai physics becomes a relevant ingredient in the analysis of energy 
absorption \cite{kbb} and transport \cite{ner} in such a ring system.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\sect{Scope}
%
Below we introduce an explicit NESS solution for a minimal model that 
has all the essential ingredients of the problem, involving transitions between sites on a ring 
and a log-wide distribution of couplings to an external driving source. 
The induced steady state current~$I$ is the central quantity used to characterize 
the NESS in actual experiments. The purpose of the present study is to investigate 
its statistics. Specifically, for a single ring we discuss how $\text{sign}(I)$ fluctuates    
as the intensity of the driving is increased, while for an ensemble 
of rings we highlight the fingerprints of Sinai physics on the $\text{abs}(I)$ distribution.  
%
\rmrk{Our model construction is physically motivated and significantly differs 
from the standard setup of e.g.\cite{sinai2}, see \cite{rm}.}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\sect{The model}
%
%
Consider a ring that consists of sites labeled by~$n$ 
with positions ${x=n}$ that are defined modulo~$N$. 
The bonds are labeled as ${\overrightarrow{n}\equiv(n{-}1 \leadsto n)}$.
The inverse bond is $\overleftarrow{n}$, and if direction does 
not matter we label both by $\bar{n}$. The position of the $n$th bond 
is defined as $x_n \equiv n{-}(1/2)$. The on-site energies $E_n$ 
are normally distributed over a range $\Delta$,  
and the transitions rates are between nearest-neighboring sites:   
%
\beq
w_{\overrightarrow{n}} \ \ = \ \ w^{\beta}_{\overrightarrow{n}} + \nu g_{\bar{n}}
\eeq 
%
Here $w^{\beta}$ are the rates that are induced by a bath that has 
a finite temperature $T_B$. The $g_{\bar{n}}$ are 
couplings to a driving source that has an intensity~$\nu$. 
These couplings are log-box distributed within ${[g_{\text{min}},g_{\text{max}}]}$.
This means that $\ln(g_{\bar{n}})$ are distributed uniformly 
over a range ${\sigma=\ln(g_{\text{max}}/g_{\text{min}})}$. 
%
%
%
%
The bath transition rates satisfy detailed-balance, 
namely $w^{\beta}_{\overrightarrow{n}}/w^{\beta}_{\overleftarrow{n}} = \exp[-(E_{n}{-}E_{n{-}1})/T_B]$.
The driving spoils the detailed-balance. We define the resulted 
stochastic field as follows:
%
\be{100}
\mathcal{E}(x_n) \ \ \equiv \ \ \ln \left[\frac{w_{\overrightarrow{n}}}{w_{\overleftarrow{n}}}\right] 
\ \approx \ - \left[ \frac{1}{1+g_{\bar{n}}\nu} \right] \frac{E_n{-}E_{n{-}1}}{T_B}
\ee
%
where the last equality assumes ${\Delta \ll T_B}$ (see \cite{SM})
and without loss of generality the $g_{\bar{n}}$ have been re-scaled 
such that all the bath-induced transitions have 
the same average transition rate ${\bar{w}^{\beta}=1}$. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\sect{The direction of the current}
%
%
$\text{sign}(I)$ is determined by the 
stochastic motive force (SMF), also known as the affinity, 
or as the entropy production \cite{eprd1,eprd2,eprd3,eprd4}:
%
\be{101}
\mathcal{E}_{\circlearrowleft} 
\ \ \equiv \ \ \ln \left[\frac{ \prod_n w_{\overrightarrow{n}}}{ \prod_n w_{\overleftarrow{n}}}\right] 
\ \ = \ \ \oint \mathcal{E}(x) \, dx 
\ee
%
\rmrk{In the second equality we formally regard $x$ as a continuous variable.
This will make the later mathematics more transparent.}  
%
Using \Eq{e100} one observes that for ${\nu \ll g_{\text{max}}^{-1}}$ 
the SMF is linear ${\mathcal{E}_{\circlearrowleft}\propto \nu}$,  
while for ${\nu \gg g_{\text{min}}^{-1}}$ it vanishes ${\mathcal{E}_{\circlearrowleft}\propto 1/\nu}$.
In the intermediate regime, which we call below {\em the Sinai regime},  
the SMF changes sign several times, see \Fig{f2}. 
Using the notations
%
\be{1021}
\tau \ \ \equiv \ \ \frac{1}{\sigma}\ln(g_{\text{max}}\nu)
\eeq
% 
and $\tau_n = (1/\sigma)\ln(g_{\text{max}}/g_{\bar{n}})$,  
the expression for the SMF takes the following form:
%
\be{102}
\mathcal{E}_{\circlearrowleft}(\tau) = -\sum_{n=1}^N f_{\sigma}(\tau-\tau_n) \frac{E_n{-}E_{n{-}1}}{T_B}
\eeq 
%
where $f_{\sigma}(t)\equiv [1+\eexp{\sigma t}]^{-1}$ is like a step function.
If $f(t)$ were a sharp step function it would follow
that in the Sinai regime $\mathcal{E}_{\circlearrowleft}(\tau)$ 
is formally like a random walk \cite{rw1,feller,dwass}. 
The number of sign reversals equals the number of times 
the random walker crosses the origin. We have here a coarse-grained 
random walk: the $\tau_n$ are distributed uniformly over a range ${[0,1]}$,  
and each step is smoothed by $f_{\sigma}(t)$ such that the 
effective number of coarse-grained steps is $\sigma$.  
Hence we expect the number of sign changes to be not $\sim\sqrt{\pi N}$ 
but $\sim\sqrt{\pi \sigma}$, reflecting the log-width of the distribution.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\sect{Adding bonds in series}
%
%
The NESS equations are quite simple and can be solved using elementary 
algebra as in \cite{Wichmann,Roling1,Nitzan,ner}, 
or optionally using the network formalism for stochastic systems \cite{net1,net2,net3}.
Below we propose a generalized resistor-network approach 
that allows to obtain a more illuminating version for the NESS, 
that will provide  better insight for the statistical analysis.  
Let us assume that we have a NESS with a current $I$. 
The steady state equations for two adjacent bonds are 
%
\beq
I &=& w_{\overrightarrow{1}} p_{0} - w_{\overleftarrow{1}}p_{1} \\
I &=& w_{\overrightarrow{2}} p_{1} - w_{\overleftarrow{2}}p_{2}
\ee
%
We can combine them into one equation: 
%
\be{8}
I = \overrightarrow{G} p_{0} - \overleftarrow{G} p_{2},  
\ \ \ \ \ 
\overrightarrow{G} \equiv 
\left[ \frac{1}{w_{\overrightarrow{1}}} + 
\frac{1}{w_{\overrightarrow{2}}} 
\left(\frac{w_{\overleftarrow{1}}}{w_{\overrightarrow{1}}}\right) \right]^{-1}
\eeq
%
and similarly for $\overleftarrow{G}$, see \cite{SM}. 
We can repeat this procedure iteratively.  
If we have $N$ bonds in series we get
%
\beq
\overrightarrow{G} \  \ = \ \ \left[ \sum_{m=1}^N \frac{1}{w_{\overrightarrow{m}}} 
\,\exp\left(-\int_0^{m{-}1}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\mathcal{E}(x)dx \right) \right]^{-1} 
\eeq
%
Coming back to the ring, we can cut it at an arbitrary site~$n$, 
and calculate the associated $G$s. 
It follows that ${I=(\overrightarrow{G}_n- \overleftarrow{G}_n) \, p_{n}}$.
Consequently the NESS is
%
\beq
p_{n} \ \ = \ \ \frac{I}{\overrightarrow{G}_n- \overleftarrow{G}_n} 
\eeq
%
and  $I$ can be regarded as the normalization factor:
%
\be{11}
I \ = \ \left[\sum_{n=1}^N \frac{1}{\overrightarrow{G}_n-\overleftarrow{G}_n}\right]^{-1}
\eeq    
%
In the next paragraph we show how to write these results 
in an explicit way that illuminates the relevant physics. 



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\sect{The NESS formula}
%
%
We define the conductance of a bond as the geometric mean 
of the clockwise and anticlockwise transmission rates: 
%
\beq  
w(x_n) \ \ = \ \ \sqrt{ w_{\overrightarrow{n}} w_{\overleftarrow{n}} }
\eeq
%
Hence $w_{\overrightarrow{n}} = w(x_n) \exp[(1/2)\mathcal{E}(x_n)]$.
Accordingly 
%
%
\be{13}
\overrightarrow{G}_n = \left[ \sum_{m=n+1}^{N+n} \frac{1}{w(x_m)} 
\,\exp\left(-\int_{n}^{x_m} \!\!\!\mathcal{E}(x)dx \right) \right]^{-1} 
\eeq
%
With the implicit understanding that the summation and the integration 
are anticlockwise modulo $N$. With the new notations it is easy to see 
that ${\overleftarrow{G}_n = \exp(-\mathcal{E}_{\circlearrowleft}) \, \overrightarrow{G}_n}$.
We use the notation $G_n$ for the geometric mean. Consequently 
the formula for the current takes the form 
%
\beq
I \ \ = \ \ \left[\sum_{n=1}^N \frac{1}{G_n}\right]^{-1} 2\sinh\left(\frac{\mathcal{E}_{\circlearrowleft}}{2}\right)
\eeq 
%
while $p_n\propto 1/G_n$. Our next task is to find a tractable
expression for the latter. Regarding $x$ as an extended coordinate, 
the potential $V(x)$ that is associated with the field $\mathcal{E}(x)$ 
is a tilted periodic potential. Adding $[\mathcal{E}_{\circlearrowleft}/N] x$
we get a periodic potential $U(x)$, see \Fig{f3}. Accordingly 
%
\beq
\int_{x'}^{x''} \!\!\!\mathcal{E}(x)dx \ = \ U(x'){-}U(x'') + \frac{\mathcal{E}_{\circlearrowleft}}{N}(x''{-}x')
\eeq  
%
With any function $A(x)$ we can associate a smoothed version 
using the following definition  
%
\beq
\sum_{r=1}^N A(x{+}r) \, \eexp{U(x{+}r)- (1/N)\mathcal{E}_{\circlearrowleft}r} \ \equiv \ A_{\varepsilon}(x) \, \eexp{U_{\varepsilon}(x)} 
\eeq
%
In particular the smoothed potential $U_{\varepsilon}(x)$ is defined by this expression with ${A=1}$. 
Note that without loss of generality it is convenient to have 
in mind ${\mathcal{E}_{\circlearrowleft}>0}$. (One can always flip the $x$~direction).  
Note also that the smoothing scale $N/\mathcal{E}_{\circlearrowleft}$ becomes larger for smaller SMF.
With the above definitions we can write the NESS expression as follows:
%
\be{17}
p_n \ \propto \ \left( \frac{1}{w(x_n)} \right)_{\varepsilon} \eexp{-(U(n)-U_{\varepsilon}(n))}
\eeq
%
This expression is physically illuminating, see \Fig{f3}. 
In the limit of zero SMF it coincides, as expected, 
with the canonical (Boltzmann) result. 
For finite SMF the smoothed pre-factor and the smoothed potential
are not merely constants. Accordingly the pre-exponential factor
becomes important and the ``slow" modulation by the Boltzmann factor 
is flattened. If we take the formal limit of infinite SMF 
the Boltzmann factor disappears and we are left with ${p_n \propto 1/w_n}$    
as expected from the continuity equation for a resistor-network. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\sect{Statistics of the current}
%
%
From the preceding analysis it should become clear that 
the formula for the current can be written schematically as 
%
\be{112}
I(\nu) \ \ \sim \ \  \frac{1}{N} \, w_{\varepsilon} \, \eexp{-B} \, 2\sinh\left(\frac{\mathcal{E}_{\circlearrowleft}}{2}\right)
\eeq
%
In the absence of a potential landscape ($U(x)=0$) the formula becomes equivalent to Ohm law: 
it is a trivial exercise to derive it if all anticlockwise and clockwise rates are equal 
to the same values $\overrightarrow{w}$ and $\overleftarrow{w}$ respectively, 
hence $w_{\varepsilon}=(\overrightarrow{w} \overleftarrow{w})^{1/2}$, 
and ${\mathcal{E}_{\circlearrowleft}=N\ln(\overrightarrow{w}/\overleftarrow{w})}$.   
In the presence of a potential landscape we have an activation barrier.
Assuming that the current is dominated by the highest peak 
a reasonable estimate would be
%
\be{113}
B = \text{max}\left\{ U(x){-}U_{\varepsilon}(x) \right\} 
\approx& \frac{1}{2} \Big[ \text{max}\{U\} - \text{min}\{U\} \Big] \ \ \ \ 
\eeq 
%
The implication of \Eq{e112} with \Eq{e113} for the {\em statistics} of the current 
is as follows: in the Sinai regime we expect that it will reflect 
the {\em log-wide} distribution of the activation factor, as discussed below, 
while outside of the Sinai regime we expect it to reflect the {\em normal} distributions 
of the total resistance~$w_{\varepsilon}^{-1}$, and of the SMF.  


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\sect{Statistics in the Sinai regime}
%
We now focus on the statistics in the Sinai regime. 
In order to unfold the log-wide statistics it is 
not a correct procedure to plot blindly the distribution 
of $\ln(|I|)$. Rather one should look on the joint 
distribution ${(\mathcal{E}_{\circlearrowleft},I)}$. 
See \Fig{f4}a. The non-trivial statistics is clearly apparent.
In order to describe it analytically we use 
the single-barrier estimate of \Eq{e113}, 
which is tested in \Fig{f4}b. We see that it 
over-estimates the current for small $B$ values 
(flat landscape) as expected, but it can be trusted 
for large $B$ where the Sinai physics becomes relevant. 

In an actual experiment it would be desired to 
extract the statistics from the $I(\nu)$ measurements 
without referring to the SMF. See \Fig{f5}.
Either way this figure confirms that the $I$ statistics
is the same as the barrier ${\exp(-B)}$ statistics. 
We therefore turn to find an explicit expression for the latter. 
%
%
The probability to have a random walk trajectory $X_n=U(x_n)$ within $[X_a,X_b]$ 
equals the survival probability in a diffusion process  
that starts as a delta function at ${X=0}$ 
with absorbing boundary conditions at $X_a$ and $X_b$.   
Integrating over all possible positions of the walls 
such that ${X_b-X_a=2B}$ is like starting with a 
uniform distribution between the walls. From here 
it is straightforward to deduce \cite{SM}
%
\be{20}
\text{Prob}\left\{\text{barrier}<B\right\} \ \sim \ \exp\left[-\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\pi \sigma_U}{2B}\right)^2\right] 
\eeq
%
where $\sigma_U^2 = 2D N$ is the variance of the diffusing `points', 
which is determined ny the diffusion coefficient $D\propto \Delta^2$.
Taking into account that for a given~$\nu$ a fraction of the elements
in \Eq{e102} are effectively zero we get 
%
\be{211}
\sigma_U^2 \ \ = \ \ 2 \Delta^2 N  \, \frac{\ln(g_{\text{max}}\nu)}{\sigma}
\eeq  
%  
The validity of the exact version of \Eq{e20}, see \cite{SM}, 
has been verified in \Fig{f4}. No fitting parameters are required. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\sect{Summary}
%
%
We have introduced a generalized ``random-resistor-network"
approach for the purpose of obtaining the NESS current
due to nonsymmetric transition rates. Specifically our 
interest was focused on the NESS of a ``glassy" mesoscopic system. 
The NESS expression clearly interpolates the canonical (Boltzmann) result 
that applies in equilibrium, with the resistor-network result, 
that applies at infinite temperature. 
Due to the ``glassiness" the current has novel dependence 
on the driving intensity, and it posseses unique statistical properties 
that reflect the Brownian landscape of the stochastic potential.
This statistics is related to Sinai's random walk problem, 
and would not arise if the couplings to the driving source 
were merely disordered.

Previous study of Sinai-type disordered systems \cite{sinai2}, 
has considered an open geometry with uncorrelated transition rates 
that have the same coupling everywhere. Consequentially 
the random-resistor-network aspect (which is related to local 
variation of the couplings) has not emerged.
%
Furthermore, in the physically motivated setup that we have 
defined above (ring+bath+driving) Sinai physics would not arise 
if the couplings to the driving source were merely disorderly random. 
The log-wide distribution is a crucial ingredient. 
%
Finally, in a closed (ring) geometry, unlike an open (two terminal) geometry, 
the statistics of~$I$ is not only affected by the distribution of transition rates, 
but also by the spatial profile of the NESS. 
This is like ``canonical" as opposed to ``grand canonical" setting, 
leading to remarkably different results.

\section{The expression for the stochastic field}

Form the detailed balance condition it follows that 
to leading order 
%
\beq
w^{\beta}_{\overrightarrow{n}} \ &\approx& \ \left[1-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{E_n-E_{n{-}1}}{T_B}\right)\right]\bar{w}_{\bar{n}}^{\beta} \\ 
w^{\beta}_{\overleftarrow{n}} \ &\approx& \ \left[1+\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{E_n-E_{n{-}1}}{T_B}\right)\right]\bar{w}_{\bar{n}}^{\beta}
\eeq  
%
Hence
%
\beq
\frac{w_{\overrightarrow{n}}}{w_{\overleftarrow{n}}} 
\ \ = \ \ \frac{w^{\beta}_{\overrightarrow{n}}+\nu g_{\bar{n}}}{w^{\beta}_{\overleftarrow{n}}+\nu g_{\bar{n}}}
\ \ \approx \ \ 1+ \frac{(E_n-E_{n{-}1})/T_B}{1+(g_{\bar{n}}/\bar{w}_{\bar{n}}^{\beta})\nu}
\eeq
%
Absorbing the bath couplings into the definition of the $g_{\bar{n}}$ we get  
%
\beq
\mathcal{E}(x_n) \ \equiv \ \ln \left[\frac{w_{\overrightarrow{n}}}{w_{\overleftarrow{n}}}\right] 
\ \approx \ - \left[ \frac{1}{1+g_{\bar{n}}\nu} \right] \frac{E_n{-}E_{n{-}1}}{T_B}
\ee
%
The SMF is obtained by integrating the stochastic field along the entire ring 
%
\be{2001}
\mathcal{E}_{\circlearrowleft} 
\ \ \approx \ \  
-\sum_{n=1}^N \left[ \frac{1}{1+g_{\bar{n}}\nu} \right] \frac{\Delta_n}{T_B}
\eeq

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Statistics of current outside of the Sinai regime}

As the driving intensity is increased one observes a crossover from 
a linear regime, to a Sinai regime, and finally a saturation regime: 
% 
\beq
\text{Linear regime:}     & \ \ \ \ \ & \ \nu < g_{max}^{-1} \\
\text{Sinai regime:}      &&  \ g_{max}^{-1} < \nu < g_{min}^{-1}\\
\text{Saturation regime:} && \ \nu > g_{min}^{-1}
\eeq
%
Consequently we get for the SMF the following approximations: 
%
\be{131}
\mathcal{E}_{\circlearrowleft} \ \ \approx \ \ 
\frac{1}{T_B}
\left\{
\amatrix{
\Delta^{(0)}\nu, & \ \ \text{Linear regime} \cr 
-\Delta^{(\infty)}/\nu , & \ \ \text{Saturation regime}
}\right.
\eeq
%
where 
%
\beq
\Delta^{(0)} &\equiv&  \sum_{n} g_{\bar{n}}  \Delta_n 
\ \ \sim  \ \ \pm \Big[2N \, \mbox{Var}(g)\Big]^{1/2} \Delta
\\
\Delta^{(\infty)} &\equiv& \sum_{n} \frac{1}{g_{\bar{n}}}  \Delta_n
\ \ \sim \ \ \pm \Big[2N \, \mbox{Var}(g^{-1})\Big]^{1/2} \Delta
\eeq
%
The estimates for $\Delta^{(0)}$ and for $\Delta^{(\infty)}$
follow from the observation that we have sums of independent 
random variables. For example $\Delta^{(0)}$ can be re-arranged 
as ${\sum_{n=1}^{N} (g_{\bar{n}+1}-g_{\bar{n}}) E_n}$.
Furthermore, we conclude that both $\Delta^{(0)} $ and $\Delta^{(\infty)}$
have {\em normal} statistics as implied by the 
central limit theorem. Consequently we expect {\em normal} statistics 
for the SMF, and hence for the current, as verified in \Fig{fa1}.

\section{Random-walk occupation-range statistics}

In this section we derived the probability density function $f(R)$ 
to have a random walk process $x(\cdot)$ of $t$ steps that occupies 
a range $R$. This is determined by the probability 
%
\beq
P_t(x_a,x_b) \ \ \equiv \ \ \text{Prob}\Big(x_a < x(t') < x_b \ \ \mbox{for any $t'\in [0,t]$}\Big)  
\eeq 
%
Accordingly the joint probability density that 
a random walker would occupy an interval ${[x_a,x_b]}$ is 
%
\beq
f(x_a,x_b) \ \ = \ \ -\frac{d}{dx_a}\frac{d}{dx_b}P_t(x_a,x_b)
\eeq
%
It is convenient to use the coordinates
%
\beq
X &=& \frac{x_a+x_b}{2} \\
R &=& x_b-x_a
\eeq
%
Consequently the expression for $f(R)$ is  
%
\beq
f(R) \ &=& \ \int_{-\infty}^{0} \int_{0}^{\infty} dx_a dx_b  
\ f(x_a,x_b) \ \delta\left(R - (x_b-x_a) \right) 
\\
f(R) \ &=& \ - \int_{-R/2}^{R/2} \left(\frac{1}{4}\partial_X^2-\partial_R^2\right) \ P_t(R,X) \ dX
\eeq
%
Taking into account that $P_t(R,X)$ and its derivatives 
vanish at the endpoints $X=\pm(R/2)$ we get
%
\be{932}
f(R) \ = \  \int_{-R/2}^{R/2} \partial_R^2 \ P_t(R,X) \ dX 
\ \ = \ \ \partial_R^2 \Big[ R \ P_t(R) \Big] 
\eeq
%
where $P_t(R)$ is the survival probability of a diffusion process 
that starts with an initial {\em uniform} distribution, instead of 
a random walk that starts as a delta distribution. 
Optionally we can write 
%
\be{933}
\text{Prob}(\text{range}<R) \ \ = \ \ \partial_R \Big[ R \ P_t(R) \Big]
\eeq
%
We now turn to find an explicit expression for $P_t(R)$. 
This is done by solving the diffusion equation. 
Using Fourier expansion the solution is
%
\beq
\rho_t(x) \ = \  \sum_{n=1,3,5,...}^{\infty} 
\exp\left[-D \left(\frac{\pi n}{R}\right)^2t\right] 
\frac{4}{\pi n R}\sin\left(\frac{\pi n}{R}x\right)
\eeq
%
For simplicity we have shifted above the domain to ${x\in[0,R]}$. 
For the survival probability we get 
%
\be{935}
P_t(R) \ \ = \ \  
\int_{0}^{R} \ \rho_t(x) \ dx 
\ \ = \ \
\sum_{n=1,3,5,...}^{\infty} 
\frac{8}{\pi^2 n^2 }
\exp\left[-D \left(\frac{\pi n}{R}\right)^2t\right] 
\eeq
%
Using \Eq{e935} in \Eq{e932} we get
%
\be{900}
f(R) \ \ = \ \ 
\frac{8\sigma^2}{R^3}
\sum_{n=1,3,5,...}^{\infty} 
\left[ \left(\frac{\pi \sigma n }{R} \right)^2 - 1 \right]
\exp\left[-\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\pi \sigma n }{R} \right)^2 \right]
\eeq
%
This result is in perfect agreement with the numerical simulation of \Fig{fb}. 
Still we would like to have a more compact expression. 
One possibility is to keep only the first term. 
The other possibility is to approximate the summation by an integral: 
%
\be{936}
\text{Prob}(\text{range}<R) 
\ \ \approx \ \ 
\frac{2}{\pi^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial R} 
\left[ R \int_1^{\infty}  \frac{dx}{x^2} \exp\left(-\frac{\pi^2Dt}{R^2}x^2 \right) \right] 
\ \ = \ \ 
\exp\left(-\frac{\pi^2Dt}{R^2}\right)
\eeq
%
Either way we get  
%
\be{937}
\text{Prob}(\text{range}<R) 
\ \ \sim \ \ 
\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\pi\sigma}{R}\right)^2\right)
\eeq
%
where ${\sigma^2=2Dt}$.
This asymptotic expression is illustrated in \Fig{fb}.
Though it does not work very well, it has the obvious 
advantage of simplicity.     


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Random-walk maximal-distance statistics}

The occupation-range statistics of the previous section should not be confused 
with the maximal-distance statistics. The maximal distance from the initial point 
is defined as follows:
%
\beq
K \ \ = \ \ \max[x(t)], \ \ \ \ \ \ \mbox{where $0<t<N$} 
\eeq
%
Naively, one might think that the probability distribution of $K$ 
is similar to the probability distribution of $R$ that has been discussed 
in the previous section. But this is not true. Furthermore, 
it is also very sensitive to whether the random walk is constrained 
to end up at the origin, ${x(N)=x(0)=0}$.  Without the latter 
constraint $f(K)$ is finite for small $K$, but if the constraint is 
taken into account, it vanishes linearly in this limit. 

It is the constrained random walk process that describes the potential $U(x)$. 
The exact result for the the $K$ statistics in this case is known \cite{dwass}:
%
\beq
\text{Prob}(K \geq k;N) \ \ = \ \  
\frac
{\left(\begin{array}{c}2N \\N-k\end{array}\right)}
{\left(\begin{array}{c}2N \\N\end{array}\right)},  
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ k = 0,1,2 \cdots N
\eeq
%
Switching variables to $\kappa=k/N$ and taking the large $N$ limit, 
one obtains the probability density function 
%
\be{50}
f(\kappa) = 
N \left[\frac{(1-\kappa)^{\kappa-1}}{(1+\kappa)^{\kappa+1}}\right]^N 
\ln \left[\frac{1+\kappa}{1-\kappa} \right] 
\ee
%
which has a peak at $\kappa \sim 1/\sqrt{2N}$.
For $\kappa\ll1$ this expression can be approximated 
by the simple function. Switching back to~$K$ 
it takes the form 
%
\be{51}
f(K) \ \ \approx \ \ \frac{2K}{N} \ \exp\left[-\frac{K^2}{N}\right]
\ee
%
In \Fig{pu}a we illustrate this distribution and 
demonstrate its applicability to the ${U(x)}$ of the ring model.
In \Fig{pu}b we illustrate the joint distribution of the 
extreme values ${x_{\text{min}}=\min[x(\cdot)]}$ and ${x_{\text{max}}=\max[x(\cdot)]}$.
The $f(R)$ distribution of the previous section corresponds to its projection 
along the diagonal direction, while the $f(K)$ distribution of the present section 
is its projection along the horizontal or vertical directions. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{More details on serial addition}

Adding two bonds in series we have obtained \Eq{e8} for $\overrightarrow{G}$ .
The formula for $\overleftarrow{G}$ is similarly obtained:  
%
\beq
\overleftarrow{G} \equiv 
\left[ \frac{1}{w_{\overleftarrow{2}}} + 
\frac{1}{w_{\overleftarrow{1}}} 
\left(\frac{w_{\overrightarrow{2}}}{w_{\overleftarrow{2}}}\right) \right]^{-1}
\eeq
%
We can repeat this procedure iteratively.  
If we have $N$ bonds in series we get
%
\beq
\overrightarrow{G} \  \ &=& \ \ \left[ \sum_{m=1}^N \frac{1}{w_{\overrightarrow{m}}} 
\,\exp\left(-\int_0^{m{-}1}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\mathcal{E}(x)dx \right) \right]^{-1} 
\\
\overleftarrow{G} \  \ &=& \ \ \left[ \sum_{m=1}^N \frac{1}{w_{\overleftarrow{m}}} 
\,\exp\left(\int_m^{N}\!\!\mathcal{E}(x)dx \right) \right]^{-1} 
\eeq
%
One should notice the miss-match between $m$ and $m{-}1$, that prevents 
of us treating the two formulas on equal footing. For this reason 
we have introduced an improved convention for the description of the 
bonds in terms of $w(x)$ leading to \Eq{e13}.

{\LARGE\bf Appeal}
\end{center}

The referees have based their recommendations on the ``general interest" of the paper 
and on a superficial similarity of the Ms to a previous submission. 
There was no scientific criticism concerning the content 
of the Ms. Comments with regard to some minor presentation 
issues were handled (see list of changes below).

%We disagree with the views on which this evaluation has been based. {\em We would appreciate the unprejudiced opinion of an independent reviewer with regard to the validity of the arguments that have been introduced by the referees.} Accordingly we treat this re-submission as an appeal. 

We believe that an additional independent reviewer would agree 
that the arguments that have been used by the referees 
to determine PRL suitability are not valid. 
Accordingly we treat this re-submission as an appeal. 
We hope to convince the reviewer that the Ms is in fact 
of {\em general interest} 
and possesses the critical mass for a PRL publication. \\

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\sect{Relation to a previous publication}
%
RefereeA identifies this Ms with a past submission that he/she had refereed two years ago. The present submission focuses on a subject that was not covered in the past submission, namely the statistics of the current in the Sinai regime. Apparently he/she did not notice that this past submission had been published in Europhysics Letters \cite{ner}, 
and had been cited explicitly in the original version of the Ms as Ref[26]. 
Consequently the referee has concluded that \textsf{``the authors could have informed their scientific community two years ago already about their findings [forming] a very nice contribution to Physical Review."}

This failure to make a distinction between the two manuscripts is apparently the main reason for the recommendations of refereeA. We believe that the recommendation whether to accept or reject our Ms should be based on the new results presented in it, and not on under-estimating the novelty of a particular equation that is required for the subsequent analysis.  \\ 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\sect{Novelty of the present submission}
%
The novelty of the present work is not related to the derivation of Eq(11).  This had been stated explicitly. Citing the original Ms: \textsf{``The NESS equations are quite simple and can be solved using elementary algebra as in [19,20,24,26]".}
%
The novelty of the present work is related to the observation that Sinai physics is reflected in the statistics of the current, as illustrated in the major figure that is now labeled as \Fig{f5}. {\em This statement is highly non-trivial as explained in the text: with superficial analysis the statistics looks normal.}

To say that Physical Reviews Letters should not publish several Letters that concern the same model is manifestly not an acceptable standpoint. To make a relevant analogy: if one Letter explains how to calculate the  ``conductance" of a ring, does it mean that one should not allow the publication of a subsequent Letter that reports ``universal conductance fluctuations"?
Indeed our previous Letter \cite{ner} and this Ms concern the same model. But clearly the subject of the present Ms, namely, reflection of glassiness in the {\em statistics} of the current, is novel, and has never been addressed to the best of our knowledge. \\


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\sect{Response to a secondary statement of referee A}
%
The referee writes:
\textsf{"The same formula for the current is derived by using, as far as I can see, the same method, just rewritten in a different way."}
%
As an answer we simply cite what we wrote in the Ms with regard to this formula: 
\textsf{"Adding bonds in series: The NESS equations are quite simple and can be solved using elementary algebra as in [19,20,24,26], [...] Below we propose a generalized resistor-network approach that allows to obtain a more illuminating version for the NESS, that will provide better insight for the statistical analysis."}

We emphasize again that the novelty of our Ms is not based on having  
introduced a resistor-network version of the formula for the current.
Rather, the novelty is primarily related to the analysis of its statistics.
In the text we were very careful to make it clear what is {\em old} 
and what is {\em new}. This distinction should not be blurred. \\

When we wrote our previous Letter \cite{ner} we were not aware of theoretical 
and experimental work that concerns essentially the same model. 
We first found out about the paper by Einax, Korner, Maass, and Nitzan \cite{Nitzan}
called \textsf{Nonlinear hopping transport in ring systems [...]}, 
and from it learned about the earlier works on this model 
\cite{Wichmann,Roling1,Roling2,Roling3} 
and about further motivation that comes from more loosely related works that we cite as well.
%
We emphasize - {\em by now we found out that this type of model is of ``general interest", 
including experimental work.} 
%
RefereeA spreads over many items his objection to the general interest in the physics of our model.
We find his/her criticism very strange. 

Our {\em rate equation} model is evidently very common as detailed in the introduction. 
To say that the references that we cite do not establish this point does not make sense. In particular we explicitly specify references to both theoretical and experimental work that contain the same(!) solution for the current. see \cite{Wichmann,Roling1,Nitzan,ner}. Still we note that our new version illuminates some resistor-network aspects that were not explicit in past versions. 

We also note that {\em log-wide} distributions are common in hopping processes 
because ${g \sim \exp(-B)}$ and also since matrix elements of quasi-integrable systems 
are subject to approximate selection rules that cause most matrix elements to be small, 
resulting in a very wide distribution, see \cite{slk} for an overview.

RefereeA has a strange attitude towards Sinai spreading: ``In my view, Sinai diffusion is a very special case due to asymmetric transition rates." 
%
We have no idea even how to address such criticism: 
Do we have to establish the interest of the Chemistry / Statistical / Physics community 
in asymmetric transition rates? Or do we have to establish the novelty or the general interest in Sinai diffusion? 
%
We are convinced that our introduction provides the proper ``zoom in" that motivates our analysis.
Clearly previous experiments did not address the statistics, and emphasized only the non-linearity 
of current vs bias. Evidently our Ms might provide a new perspective for experimental study:
not only "signal" but also the "statistics" are informative.

We point out that in the electrical context theoretical work had indeed motivated experiments that were aimed at exploring statistics of currents in mesoscopic rings [Reulet, Ramin, Bouchiat, Mailly, PRL 75, 124 (1995)]. We see no reasons to insist that a similar perspective should not be encouraged with regard to non-coherent transport. \\

\sect{Glassiness and Sinai physics}
%
Per the requirement of refereeA we further relate to the notion 
of glassiness and try to establish the related interest in Sinai physics.   

Glassiness means ``log wide distribution of time scales". It typically arises 
in studies of models with a random energy landscape (the list of papers is endless). 
We now cite the reference that has been mentioned by refereeA \cite{Rit1}.
%
We also looked at Ritort's website where he writes that \textsf{"Scientists start 
to agree that the physics of glasses... characterized by a wide distribution 
of relaxational timescales (heterogeneous kinetics)"}, the standard example 
being spin-glass models \cite{Rit2}. 

Sales, Bouchaud and Ritort \cite{Rit3} discuss Sinai physics in the context of glassy systems.
%
An experimental observation of Sinai diffusion regarding the unzipping transition of DNA
has been reported by Lubensky and Nelson \cite{Nelson} pointing out that "polynucleotide unzipping provides an experimental realization of the famous Sinai problem of thermally activated diffusion in a quenched random force field". 
%
Sinai physics is relevant for the analysis of the motion of a domain wall 
in the random field Ising model, see Corberi, Candia, Lippiello, and Zannetti \cite{domainwalls}. 
%
and also to the description of some tapping experiments in sand piles, 
see Luding, Nicolas and Pouliquen \cite{sandpiles}. \\

\sect{Response to the major argument of referee B}
%
Essentially the argument is that some mathematical approximations would be understood only by experts. \textsf{``In the end, the math tricks get in the way [of the general reader]"}.
%
We would like to claim that the existence of a stressing stage in the algebra 
should not be regarded as a valid argument against PRL publication. 

The main message of this paper, as demonstrated in \Fig{f5}, is that the statistics of the current 
contains fingerprints of "glassiness" related to Sinai physics. This message should be understood 
and appreciated by any "general reader", irrespective of technicalities. \\


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\sect{Response to a secondary item of referee B}
%
The referee complains that he/she cannot make sense of our mathematics, namely, why to write sums as integrals. But then he/she gives the answer: \textsf{"Apparently because this makes possible the trick that appears in Eq.(13)...".}
%
So there is nothing for us to answer here, just to point out that the previous versions of the same formula, \cite{Wichmann,Roling1,Nitzan,ner}, are not tractable for the purpose of our statistical analysis.  Furthermore, we believe that a simple comparison with the cited references will convince the reader that our notations help to gain intuition into the mathematics, and better connect it to the physical picture.
%
In any case we followed the referee suggestion to better clarify the model, and added 
remark regarding notation issue. \\

\sect{Presentation issues / List of changes}
%
The introduction has been improved in order to reflect better 
some ``motivation" issues that have been debated by refereeA.
Additional relevant references have been added. 
Otherwise there were only 4 action items with regard to the presentation:
%
{\bf \ \ [A5,B1]:}
Both referees wrote that former Fig1, the "artistic" illustration of the model, is not helpful. 
We therefore moved it to the supplementary and used the space for a more detailed explanation of the model as suggested by referee B.
%
{\bf \ \ [A7]:}
Color code in Fig2b (now Fig1b) is now explained in the caption.
%
{\bf \ \ [B2]:}
The word "tangible" has been replaced by "tractable".
